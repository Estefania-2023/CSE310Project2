# Overview

This project is a console-based Basic Calculator application written in Erlang. The goal of this software is to strengthen my understanding of Erlang’s syntax by building a small but complete application.
The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It interacts with the user through the Erlang shell, reads input safely, validates operations, and displays results clearly.
My purpose in writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Erlang features such as recursion, pattern matching, guards, immutable variables, and list processing. By implementing a calculator, I was able to focus on core language concepts while practicing clean functional design and error handling.

# Development Environment

-Visual Studio Code as the code editor
-Erlang/OTP installed locally
-Erlang shell (erl) to compile and run the program

The programming language used is Erlang, a functional language designed for concurrency and reliability.
Standard Erlang libraries were used, including:
-io for input and output
-lists for list processing and iteration

# Future Work

- Add exception handling using try/catch
- Allow input without requiring a trailing period (.)
- Extend the calculator with additional operations and history tracking
